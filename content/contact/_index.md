I work as an App Developer in Western Canada.  I also dabble in electronics, game development, and maker projects on the side.

I have worked with many different stacks and have always been able to get up-to-speed quickly.  The satisfaction of creation solving problems drives me.  Conveniently there's no shortage of problems to solve in software development.

Currently I feel strongest in:
- C# / ASP.NET
- Golang
- AngularJS
- ReactJS
