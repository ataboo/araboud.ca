I am an application developer and hobbyist located in Western Canada.  Typically I design and code web applications, but I also work with embedded software/electronics, and mobile applications.  I am driven to learn new things and find creative solutions for problems.

I am comfortable with several different stacks and have been able to get "up to speed" quickly with new technologies.  The last 4 years of professional development and contributing to the odd open source project, has given me strong collaborative skills.  I feel that I am transitioning into a "force-multiplying" role, and it's very rewarding to guide new devs down the same exciting path.
