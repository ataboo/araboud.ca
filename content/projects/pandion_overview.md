I have started getting into R/C aircraft recently and have been building a small twin rotor VTOL.  The eventual plan is for it to be an aerial imaging platform that doesn't need a runway for launch and retrieval.  For now, just getting it to hover stably has been quite the challenge.

## Configuration

The configuration is pretty close to a V-22 Osprey so the genus Pandion seemed like an appropriate name.  The main engines convert from vertical to horizontal with a small ducted fan on the rear to control pitch while hovering.  Initially I had planned on this being a tri-copter with even distribution and forward sweeping wings on conversion, but this had a lot of un-needed complexity.
