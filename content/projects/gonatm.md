I usually use Trello for tracking tasks in home projects, but have been interested in logging time.  This was a good excuse to try out a proper React app with Golang back-end.  I have found Gin very handy and I think it will be my server of choice for Go moving forward.

Feel free to check out the [project on github](https://github.com/ataboo/go-natm.git) but be warned that it is very much a work in progress.
